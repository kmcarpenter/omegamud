# OmegaMUD

An old text adventure mud I used to hack away on and run. This is a derivative of the Envy based muds from back in the day.

## My Contributions

I'm sure there's more to this, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

* Religous quests (rel_quest.c)
  * Randomly generated dungeons with an objective
  * Point earned for special items
* Crafting system (crafting.c)
  * Skills to skin hides from monster corpses
  * Random crafting
* Skills learned by usage
  * Previously had to train
* Memory corruption fixes (using mmgr.cpp)
* Port to windows
* Database storage instead of files (sqldb.c)
  * DB Structure lost :(
