# OmegaMUD

An old text adventure mud I used to hack away on and run. This is a derivative of the Envy based muds from back in the day.

## My Contributions

I'm sure there's more to this, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

* Religous quests (rel_quest.c)
  * Randomly generated dungeons with an objective
  * Point earned for special items
* Crafting system
  * Randrom drops of crafting supplies
  * Random crafting (I think)
* Skills learned by usage
  * Previously had to train
* Memory corruption fixes
* Port to windows
* Database storage instead of files (sqldb.c)
  * DB Structure lost :(
